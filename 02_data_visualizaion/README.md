# Data Visualization & EDA

This module is dedicated to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal of these workbooks is to translate raw numbers into visual insights, allowing us to understand data distributions, identify outliers, and discover correlations before moving into the modeling phase.

## Visualization Techniques

In this folder, the implementations focus on three main levels of analysis:

### 1. Univariate Analysis
* **Histograms & KDE Plots:** Understanding the distribution and skewness of a single variable.
* **Box Plots:** Identifying outliers and understanding the quartiles/spread of the data.
* **Count Plots:** Visualizing the frequency of categorical variables.

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
* **Scatter Plots:** Examining the relationship and trend between two continuous variables.
* **Bar Charts:** Comparing categorical groups against a numerical value.
* **Line Plots:** Analyzing trends over a continuous interval (e.g., Time Series).

### 3. Multivariate Analysis
* **Heatmaps:** Visualizing correlation matrices to identify multicollinearity.
* **Pair Plots:** A grid of scatter plots showing relationships across all features in a dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
* **Matplotlib:** The foundational library for creating static, high-quality visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib for more complex, aesthetically pleasing plots.
* **Pandas Plotting:** For quick, high-level plotting directly from DataFrames.

## Key Objectives
* **Pattern Recognition:** Finding trends that are not visible in raw tables.
* **Insight Discovery:** Detecting anomalies and potential data quality issues.
* **Feature Selection Support:** Using correlation heatmaps to decide which features are most relevant for the target variable.
