# Regression Analysis 📉

This folder contains implementations of regression models used to predict continuous numerical values. The focus is on understanding the relationship between independent variables and a target outcome.



## Algorithms Implemented
* **Linear Regression:** The foundational baseline model.
* **Ridge & Lasso:** Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
* **Polynomial Regression:** Modeling non-linear relationships by transforming features.
* **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Using SVM principles for continuous value prediction.

## Metrics for Evaluation
* Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* R-squared ($R^2$) Score
