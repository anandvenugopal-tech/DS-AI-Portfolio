# Deep Learning

## Definition
**Deep Learning** is a subset of Machine Learning that uses **multi-layered neural networks** to automatically learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.

It enables models to learn **hierarchical representations**, making it especially effective for tasks involving images, text, audio, and sequential data.

## Core Idea
Deep Learning models consist of multiple layers of neurons where:
- Lower layers learn simple features
- Higher layers learn complex and abstract representations

This layered learning allows deep learning models to outperform traditional machine learning methods on complex problems.
