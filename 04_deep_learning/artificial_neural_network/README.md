# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Overview

The ANN is used to learn patterns from structured data and evaluate its performance using common machine learning metrics.

---

## Objectives
- Apply an Artificial Neural Network to a real dataset
- Follow a complete machine learning workflow
- Train and evaluate a deep learning model
- Understand the role of ANN within supervised learning

---

## Machine Learning Workflow
The project follows a typical ML pipeline:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling and train–test split  
3. ANN model definition  
4. Model training  
5. Performance evaluation  
6. Prediction and analysis
