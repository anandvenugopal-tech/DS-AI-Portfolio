# Computer Vision

## Definition
**Computer Vision** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to **interpret, analyze, and understand visual information** such as images and videos, similar to how humans perceive vision.

It combines concepts from **image processing, machine learning, and deep learning** to extract meaningful information from visual data.

## What Computer Vision Involves
- Image acquisition and representation
- Image preprocessing and enhancement
- Feature extraction from images
- Object, face, and pattern recognition
- Video analysis and real-time vision systems

---

## Relationship with Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **Classical Computer Vision** relies on hand-crafted features and algorithms
- **Machine Learning–based CV** uses learned features for prediction tasks
- **Deep Learning–based CV** (e.g., CNNs) automatically learns hierarchical visual features

Computer Vision is an **application domain of Deep Learning**, not a replacement for it.
