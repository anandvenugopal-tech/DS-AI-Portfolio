# DS-AI-Portfolio

This repository is a structured archive of my work files across the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence landscape. It focuses on the modular components of the machine learning lifecycle, documenting the transition from raw data to predictive modeling.

### Data Foundations
* **`01_data_preprocessing/`**: Workbooks for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
* **`02_data_visualization/`**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical data plotting.

### Machine Learning
* **`03_machine_learning/regression/`**: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial, and SVR models.
* **`03_machine_learning/classification/`**: Implementations of k-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Boosting.
* **`03_machine_learning/clustering/`**: Unsupervised learning via K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.
* **`03_machine_learning/dimensionality_reduction/`**: PCA, LDA, and t-SNE techniques.

### Deep Learning
* **`05_deep_learning/`**: Neural network architectures including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Complete Workflow
* **`06_end_to_end_project/`**: Integrated files connecting preprocessing, ML models, and evaluation into a single pipeline.
